|     [Hello world](./results/hello_world/README.md)     | Server responds with simple `"hello world"` text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|     [File server](./results/file_server/README.md)     | Static file server, where server needs to respond with files in given directory                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [Multiple routes](./results/multiple_routes/README.md) | Server with multiple routes: <ul> <li> `/hello_world (GET)` – returns `"hello world"`</li> <li> `/random_number (GET)` – returns random number from 0 to 1</li> <li> `plus_1 (POST)` – adds 1 to the counter </li><li> `minus_1 (POST)` – subtracts 1 from the counter </li><li> `count (GET)` – return counter value</li> </ul> |

More benchmarks are planned! <br> However if you have an idea for real-world scenario that frameworks speed should be
tested for, please create an issue about it!

## 🏁 Benchmarking

Benchmarks are done on my PC! <br> This is because `Github Actions` is too slow to unleash the beast from some of the
frameworks and provides unreliable results.

My CPU is an `AMD Ryzen 7 5700G` and is cooled well enough where temps don't exceed 55°C during heavy-use. <br> I make
sure that nothing is running in the background while doing benchmarks.

Benchmarks are run after:

- Every update to any of the modules
- Change has been made to source code of benchmarking tool
- New benchmarks have been added
- New Deno version is out

## 🤝 Contributing

**http_benchmarks** is open for any contributions.
<br /> If you feel like you can enhance this project - please open an issue and/or pull request.

This project follows [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) spec.

Benchmark code should look like so:<br> _Description is optional, you can leave it as empty string._

```ts
export const NAME = "";
export const DESCRIPTION = "";
export const VERSION = "";

if (import.meta.main) {
  // ...your framework code
}
```

## 🙏 To dear web framework developers

If you can, please contribute to this project by creating a pull request where you add code for benchmarks for your
framework. <br> I should be able to update versions of them myself from that time, and I'll try to add as many
benchmarks as I can.
</br> However that'd make it a lot easier, since you know how to write code for that framework better (and faster!).
